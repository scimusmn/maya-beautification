## To Do 
+ Fill in actual Spanish content, adjust layout as needed.
+ Set up the exhibit computers (fonts, kiosk software, program)

### Long Term
+ The next version will implement a C++ library that can do live manipulation of video.
+ In the future, this might connect to the Internet, allowing visitors to e-mail their images to themselves. 
Will probably need to set up PHP for this.

## Install
+ No special instructions yet.
