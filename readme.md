# Maya Beautification 

## Description 
The ancient Maya had standards of beauty that involved both temporary adornments and jewelry and permanent body modification.
See yourself wearing all these adornments.

### Long Term
+ The next version will implement a C++ library that can do live manipulation of video.
+ In the future, this might connect to the Internet, allowing visitors to e-mail their images to themselves. 
Will probably need to set up PHP for this.

## Install
+ Set up a local webserver with SSL - this allows for saving the "Always allow webcam access" setting in Chrome.
+ Install [Stele](https://github.com/scimusmn/stele) and set Delay in the config to True.
