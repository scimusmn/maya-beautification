# Maya Beautification 

## Description 
The ancient Maya had standards of beauty that involved both temporary adornments and jewelry and permanent body modification.
See yourself wearing all these adornments.

## Roadmap
+ Design the interface to work well in a vertically-oriented 1920 x 1080 monitor.
+ Add Touch Punch (and maybe Hammer) JS library for touchscreen support.
+ Allow draggable elements to be resized using pinch/spread finger movements.
+ Add a button for retaking your photo.
+ Add a screensaver/timeout function to run after 3 min of inactivity.
+ Add more beautification options. Maybe group these by characters, like noble man/woman, ball player, scribe, soldier...
+ Implement Grunt.js for minifying/concatenating JS and CSS files.
+ Set up the exhibit computer and camera, which will take larger photos.

### Long Term
+ The next version will implement a C++ library that can do live manipulation of video.
+ In the future, this might connect to the Internet, allowing visitors to e-mail their images to themselves.
