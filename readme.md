# Maya Beautification 

## Description 
The ancient Maya had standards of beauty that involved both temporary adornments and jewelry and permanent body modification.
See yourself wearing all these adornments.

## Roadmap
+ ~~Add Touch Punch (and maybe Hammer) JS library for touchscreen support.~~
+ ~~Allow draggable elements to be resized using pinch/spread finger movements.~~
+ ~~Add a button for starting over.~~
+ ~~Add a screensaver/timeout function to run after 3 min of inactivity.~~
+ Add more beautification options. ~~Maybe group these by characters, like noble man/woman, ball player, scribe, soldier...~~
+ ~~Implement Grunt.js for minifying/concatenating JS and CSS files.~~
+ Fill in actual text content.
+ ~~Implement language switcher.~~
+ ~~Add a countdown so that you have 5 seconds between hitting "Take photo" and the image capture~~
+ Set up the exhibit computers
  + ~~Set up webcam, see how large of photos it can take~~
  + ~~Set up local webserver on Windows~~
  + ~~Set up SSL for localhost~~
  + Set up Chrome to bypass SSL warning on first page load

### Long Term
+ The next version will implement a C++ library that can do live manipulation of video.
+ In the future, this might connect to the Internet, allowing visitors to e-mail their images to themselves. 
Will probably need to set up PHP for this.

## Install
+ No special instructions yet.
