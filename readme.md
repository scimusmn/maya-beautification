# Maya Beautification 

## Description 
The ancient Maya had standards of beauty that involved both temporary adornments and jewelry and permanent body modification.
See yourself wearing all these adornments.

## Roadmap
+ Develop a version using images captured from an HTML-based front-end and the ImageMagick library. This will need to run locally on the exhibit computer.
+ The next version will implement a C++ library that can do live manipulation of video.
+ In the future, this might connect to the Internet, allowing visitors to e-mail their images to themselves.

## Install
